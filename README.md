# DispML: A Remote ML Job Scheduler

A lightweight, socket-based system to distribute machine learning training jobs from a central server to multiple remote worker machines.  
This project aims to simulate a minimal GPU-renting or compute-sharing platform for ML model training.

- > ⚒️ UNDER PROGRESS
- > ⚠️ Currently supports only CPU workers.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📤 Send a directory containing full training `datasets + scripts` from server to worker
- 🧠 Train models remotely on remote worker machines
- 🔁 Auto job assignment: idle workers are picked automatically and jobs are assigned to them
- 🔄 Auto-retry: if a worker dies mid-job, the job is reassigned to another worker and dead worker is dropped
- ❤️ Heartbeat checks: continiously check wheter the worker alive or not
- 🪵 Logging: in terminal shows which worker is doing what

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

**`SERVER --> WORKER` communication:**

- 📡 Workers connect and register
- ⌚ Workers are listed and they wait to get a job assigned to them by server
- 📥 Server maintains a job queue
- ⏳ if job queue is empty Server waits for jobs, assigns work
- 🛠️ Workers receive scripts, train model, and send back trained model
- 📶 Server tracks worker health

---

## ⚒️ Current Limitations 
(working on this)

- ❗ No GPU support yet (easy to add)
- ❗ No multi-worker distribution per job (1 job → 1 worker)
- ❗ No database/backend — everything is socket-based and in-memory

---
## ✍️ Mandatory Instructions
- > Project directory structure should not be changed
- > If running the server and worker on diffrent devices make sure to change the IP address in main_server.py and main_worker.py to IP_add of host
  

## ⚙️ Setup & Run


```(bash
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/distributed-ml-server.git
cd distributed-ml-server

2. Start the Server
python main_server.py

3. Start One or More Workers
(on same or different machines)
python main_worker.py


🗂️ Project Structure
├── servers
    main_server.py
    server_1.py
    get_info.py
    all_models
      waiting
        #here should be the project directory with main model script as ***modelss.py*** 
      working
        #after the job gets assigned the project directory will be transfered here
├── workers
    main_worker.py
    worker_1.py
```

## 💡 Ideas for Future Expansion
- ✅ worker filtering over available gpu
- ✅ Parallel training (split one job across multiple workers)
- ✅ Web dashboard using FastAPI or Flask
- ✅ Secure file transfer (encryption, verification)

## 👤 About the Creator
- This project was developed by ***DHIRENDRA KUMAR*** (Krdhirendra) as a solo learner.
-  AI tools (like ChatGPT and DeepSeek) has been extensively used to assist with coding, but the architecture, logic, and execution were fully self-built.

⏱️ Built over several fragmented days effort (due to academic load lol).
